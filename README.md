# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This project is a simple yet classic implementation of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to mark three consecutive spaces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Features
- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design, playable on various devices.
- Two-player mode: Play against a friend locally.
- Simple and easy-to-understand gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure and layout of the game.
- CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal.
- JavaScript: For implementing game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to make their move.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
